This repository serves two main functions:

1. **Launch gOS Apps**: Click on app icons to start them in a new browser tab
2. **Show gOS Components**: Demonstrate and test the gOS UI components (panels, cards, collection browsers, etc.) on a single home page

gOS provides reusable UI components that apps can use:

- **Panel**: Toggle-able drawer with resizer
- **Card**: Draggable and resizable canvas elements
- **Collection Browser**: Grid/list view for collections with drag & drop
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time app health checking
- **DnD System**: Delegated drag sources and drop targets
